# Explore weather trend

## Introduction

This is an introductory project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree program in Udacity.

## Objective

- Students will extract the weather trend data from Udacity database using sql queries. Specifically, the query will extract average global temperature data and a local temperature data of the closest city to where each student lives.

- Students will create visualizations from these data by comparing the relationship between global temperature trend and temperature trend of their local city.

- Finally, students will draw conclusions and write their observations in a report.

## Prerequisites

- You need to be able to work with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) on your computer

- You also need to be able to open files using your preferred spreadsheet application.

## Deployment
To deploy this project on your machine, the source_file folder contains the following files:
- project1.tex
- project1.pdf
- ave.pdf
- temps.pdf

When you download the folder to your local machine, ensure that the all files are in the same folder for proper code functionality; then read the project1.tex file.

Steps on how to produce the figures ave.pdf and temps.pdf are listed in the project1.tex file.
